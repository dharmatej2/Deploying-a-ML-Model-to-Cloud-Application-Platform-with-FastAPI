## Model Details
Model Version: 1.0
Model Type: Logistic Regression
Task: Binary classification (predicting salary class: <=50K or >50K)
Training Data: UCI Adult Income Dataset (census dataset)
Target Variable: salary (with values: <=50K, >50K)

## Intended Use
This model predicts whether an individual earns more than $50K per year based on demographic features. It is intended for use in applications like income classification.

## Potential Misuse
The model may not generalize well to datasets outside of the U.S. or that significantly differ from the training data.

## Training Data
Dataset: UCI Adult Income Dataset
Number of Samples: 32,561
Features: Includes demographic features like age, education, occupation, race, and native country.

## Limitations
May not generalize well to non-U.S data.
Potential biases due to the demographic features in the dataset.

## Evaluation
Model performance was evaluated using a holdout test set. The following table summarizes the performance of the model on the test set:

## Ethical Considerations
Biases in Data: The model is trained on demographic data which may contain biases. Features like race, sex, and education level may introduce discrimination if the model is used improperly.

airness: Care should be taken to ensure fairness, particularly in sensitive applications such as hiring or lending.

## Caveats and Recommendations
Generalization: This model may not perform well on data outside the U.S. or data that differs significantly from the training set.

Bias: The model could be biased due to the demographic variables in the dataset. It is essential to evaluate fairness before deploying it in sensitive areas.

Usage: Itâ€™s recommended to combine this model with additional fairness checks and other data sources to avoid discriminatory outcomes.
